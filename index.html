			<p> Cycling in New York City has recently grown in popularity lately due to the growing accessibility of CitiBike and decreased confidence in the MTA. </p>

			<p> Increased ridership has also brought about more accidents on the road, especially in the outer boroughs which have fewer protected bike lanes. 2019 saw a high number of cyclist fatalaties, at 29 people killed. 2020 has proven to not be far behind, with 23 people killed by the end of November. Brooklyn is an accident hot spot for a few reasons, mainly the higher number of bikers in the borough but also the lack of protected bike lanes as compared to Manhattan. </p>
